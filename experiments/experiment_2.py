"""
This is a synthetic experiment to display the properties of the Favard kernel 
approach. We use a dataset constructed as used in the paper "On the effect of
the input density distribution on kernel based classifiers 
(Seeger and Williams, 2000).
It also provides a clear example of how to construct a model with our technique.
